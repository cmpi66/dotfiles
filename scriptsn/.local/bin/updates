# update script using rofi

# i have to take into account portage one shot updates, either I bake it in or another command sees the output of emaint to check if theres a portage update needed and it updates. Then we do the the whole dance.

# but is this even viable on gentoo when sometimes we might get use/keyword changes?
#

# maybe we do it in stages? just one command/selection to update?
