# this will be a script that will open up the current pdfs im reading on upskilling e.g blackhat python, blackhat bash, bug bounty book and pracical vim. Obviously i wont read all 4 at once but since these books are reference and slow burns you can do 15-30 mins on each and the ROI will still be sufficient.

# I can either do this manually or by modfied date, but does linux detect that on pdf files? last time they were opened?

# the names are extrememly long though, maybe hardcoed them into variables?

# this is a dynamic script, books will be replaced with most curent reads, i have the open pdf scrip but that traverses the entier dir for over 200+ pdfs.
